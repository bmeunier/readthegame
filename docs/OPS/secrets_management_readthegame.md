- **Key:** `PYANNOTE_API_KEY`

## Storage & Access

- Secrets are stored in:
  - Local `.env` file for dev
  - Vercel environment variables for frontend
  - Inngest environment variables for orchestration
- Never commit `.env` files to Git

---

## Rotation Policy

- Rotate all API keys every 90 days or on suspected compromise
- Document rotation in commit notes
- Validate rotated keys by re-running a test ingestion

---

## Handling Failures

- If key is missing or invalid:
  - Deepgram â†’ returns 401  
  - pyannote â†’ returns 401  
  - Supabase â†’ connection error  

Resolution: verify environment variables are set and valid.
